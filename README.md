# StreamMonitor
program that will automatically monitor youtube livestreams. Initially goal is to guarantee that the stream has audio




after seaching for a while I found two approaches to grab a youtube stream, lets test them to see if they would work with us
ideally this would have the least delay possible


another option would be to use a webscrapper like selenium and simulate the user
    this would make the monitor be as close to the user as possible
